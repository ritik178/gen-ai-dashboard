## Overview
Gen AI Analytics is a React-based web application that allows users to input queries and receive AI-generated responses. The application maintains a history of queries and their results, displaying them in a visually appealing UI with data visualization.

## Features

- **AI-Simulated Responses:** Generates mock AI responses for demonstration.
- **Query History:** Displays previous queries along with their results.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses Chart.js to present numerical results in a bar chart.
- **State Management:** Implements Redux Toolkit for efficient state handling.
- **Dark Mode Support:** UI is styled to support dark mode.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components:** React Icons
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js
